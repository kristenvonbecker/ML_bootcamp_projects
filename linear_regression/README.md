# Linear Regression

This mini-project accesses the very outdated Boston housing data set.

Outline:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Summary statistics
- Scatterplots (using both Matplotlib and Seaborn) in order to investigate linear relationships between pairs of numerical features
- Histograms (using Matplotlib) in order to understand numerical data distributions and determine whether to normalize or standardize a feature
- Linear regression (using Statsmodels and Scikit-learn) to predict price
  - Fit, predict, and score
  - Interpretting coefficients 
  - Evaluating the model (using sum-of-squares, R^2, MSE, F-statistic)
